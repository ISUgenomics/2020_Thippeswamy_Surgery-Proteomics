 ## Fold Change

The following tables present the fold change information about the significant proteins (p < 0.01). Up or down regulation is addressed with `green` and `red` for up and down regulated expression level in the `color` columns.

* ###  KA-NoSurgery vs. KA-NoSurgery
Fold change is estimated based on the assumption that `KA-NoSurgery` condition is the control. The table is also accessible from [here](FoldChange/KA_NoSurgery.vs.Ka_Surgery.md).
